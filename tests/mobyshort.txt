caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical 
professor yes as everyone knows meditation andli 
water are wedded forever 

but here is an artist he desires to paint you the 
dreamiest shadiest quietest most enchanting bit of 
romantic landscape in all the valley of the saco what 
is the chief element he employs  there stand his trees 
each with a hollow trunk as if a hermit and a crucifix 
were within  and here sleeps his meadow and there sleep 
his cattle  and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy 
smoke deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way 
reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in 
their hillside blue but though the picture lies thus 
tranced and though this pinetree shakes down its sighs 
like leaves upon this shepherds head yet all were 
vain unless the shepherds eye were fixed upon the 
magic stream before him go visit the prairies in june 
when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee deep 
among tigerlilies what is the one charm wanting  
water there is not a drop of water there  were niagara 
but a cataract of sand would you travel your thousand 
miles to see it  why did the poor poet of tennessee 
upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver deliberate 
whether to buy him a coat which he sadly needed or 
invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach  
why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust 
healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to 
sea  why upon your first voyage as a passenger did 
you yourself feel such a mystical vibration when first  
told that you and your ship were now out of sight of  
land  why did the old persians hold the sea holy  
why did the greeks give it a separate deity and own 
brother of jove  surely all this is not without meaning 
and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus 
who because he could not grasp the tormenting mild

image he saw in the fountain plunged into it and was 
drowned but that same image we ourselves see in all 
rivers and oceans it is the image of the ungraspable 
phantom of life  and this is the key to it all 

now when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea 
whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eyes and begin 
to be over conscious of my lungs i do not mean to have 
it inferred that i ever go to sea as a passenger for to 
go as a passenger you must needs have a purse and a 
purse is but a rag unless you have something in it be 
sides passengers get seasick grow quarrelsome dont 
sleep of nights do not enjoy themselves much as a 
general thing  no i never go as a passenger  nor 
though i am something of a salt do i ever go to sea as a 
commodore or a captain or a cook i abandon the 
glory and distinction of such offices to those who like 
them for my part i abominate all honourable respect 
able toils trials and tribulations of every kind what 
soever it is quite as much as i can do to take care 
of myself without taking care of ships barques brigs 
schooners and what not and as for going as cook 
though i confess there is considerable glory in that a 
cook being a sort of officer on shipboard yet somehow 
i never fancied broiling fowls  though once broiled 
judiciously buttered and judgmatically salted and 
peppered there is no one who will speak more respect 
fully not to say reverentially of a broiled fowl than i 
will it is out of the idolatrous do tings of the old 
egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that 
you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge 
bakehouses the pyramids 

no when i go to sea i go as a simple sailor right 
before the mast plumb down into the forecastle aloft 
there to the royal masthead true they rather order 
me about some and make me jump from spar to spar
