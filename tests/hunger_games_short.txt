back of her blouse has become untucked and hangs out over her skirt its this detail the untucked blouse forming a ducktail that brings me back to myself prim the strangled cry comes out of my throat and my muscles begin to move again prim i dont need to shove through the crowd the other kids make way immediately allowing me a straight path to the stage i reach her just as she is about to mount the steps with one sweep of my arm i push her behind me i volunteer i gasp i volunteer as tribute theres some confusion on the stage district 12 hasnt had a volunteer in decades and the protocol has become rusty the rule is that once a tributes name has been pulled from the ball another eligible boy if a boys name has been read or girl if a girls name has been read can step forward to take his or her place in some districts in which winning the reaping is such a great honor people are eager to risk their lives the volunteering is complicated but in district 12 where the wordtribute is pretty much synonymous with the word corpse volunteers are all but extinct lovely says effie trinket but i believe theres a small matter of introducing the reaping winner and then asking for volunteers and if one does come forth then we um she trails off unsure herself what does it matter says the mayor hes looking at me with a pained expression on his face he doesnt know me really but theres a faint recognition there i am the girl who brings the strawberries the girl his daughter might have spoken of on occasion the girl who five years ago stood huddled with her mother and sister as he presented her the oldest child with a medal of valor a medal for her father vaporized in the mines does he remember that what does it matter he repeats gruffly let her come forward prim is screaming hysterically behind me shes wrapped her skinny arms around me like a vice no katniss no you cant go prim let go i say harshly because this is upsetting me and i dont want to cry when they televise the replay of the reapings tonight everyone will make note of my tears and ill be marked as an easy target a weakling i will give no one that satisfaction let go i can feel someone pulling her from my back i turn and see gale has lifted prim off the ground and shes thrashing in his arms up you go catnip he says in a voice hes fighting to keep steady and then he carries prim off toward my mother i steel myself and climb the steps well bravo gushes effie trinket thats the spirit of the games shes pleased to finally have a district with a little action going on in it whats your name i swallow hard katniss everdeen i say i bet my buttons that was your sister dont want her to steal all the glory do we come on everybody lets give a big round of applause to our newest tribute trills effie trinket to the everlasting credit of the people of district 12 not one person claps not even the ones holding betting slips the ones who are usually beyond caring possibly because they know me from the hob or knew my father or have encountered prim who no one can help loving so instead of acknowledging applause i stand there unmoving while they take part in the boldest form of dissent they can manage silence which says we do not agree we do not condone all of this is wrong then something unexpected happens at least i dont expect it because i dont think of district 12 as a place that cares about me but a shift has occurred since i stepped up to take prims place and now it seems i have become someone precious at first one then another then almost every member of the crowd touches the three middle fingers of their left hand to their lips and holds it out to me it is an old and rarely used gesture of our district occasionally seen at funerals it means thanks it means admiration it means goodbye to someone you love now i am truly in danger of crying but fortunately haymitch chooses this time to come staggering across the stage to congratulate me look at her look at this one he hollers throwing an arm around my shoulders hes surprisingly strong for such a wreck i like her his breath reeks of liquor and its been a long time since hes bathed lots of he cant think of the word for a while spunk he says triumphantly more than you he releases me and starts for the front of the stage more than you he shouts pointing directly into a camera is he addressing the audience or is he so drunk he might actually be taunting the capitol ill never know because just as hes opening his mouth to continue haymitch plummets off the stage and knocks himself unconscious hes disgusting but im grateful with every camera gleefully trained on him i have just enough time to release the small choked sound in my throat and compose myself i put my hands behind my back and stare into the distance i can see the hills i climbed this morning with gale for a moment i yearn for something the idea of us leaving the district making our way in the woods but i know i was right about not running off because who else would have volunteered for prim haymitch is whisked away on a stretcher and effie trinket is trying to get the ball rolling again what an exciting day she warbles as she attempts to straighten her wig which has listed severely to the right but more excitement to come its time to choose our boy tribute clearly hoping to contain her tenuous hair situation she plants one hand on her head as she crosses to the ball that contains the boys names and grabs the first slip she encounters she zips back to the podium and i dont even have time to wish for gales safety when shes reading the name peeta mellark peeta mellark oh no i think not him because i recognize this name although i have never spoken directly to its owner peeta mellark no the odds are not in my favor today i watch him as he makes his way toward the stage medium height stocky build ashy blond hair that falls in waves over his forehead the shock of the moment is registering on his face you can see his struggle to remain emotionless but his blue eyes show the alarm ive seen so often in prey yet he climbs steadily onto the stage and takes his place effie trinket asks for volunteers but no one steps forward he has two older brothers i know ive seen them in the bakery but one is probably too old now to volunteer and the other wont this is standard family devotion only goes so far for most people on reaping day what i did was the radical thing the mayor begins to read the long dull treaty of treason as he does every year at this point — its required — but im not listening to a word why him i think then i try to convince myself it doesnt matter peeta mellark and i are not friends not even neighbors we dont speak our only real interaction happened years ago hes probably forgotten it but i havent and i know i never will it was during the worst time my father had been killed in the mine accident three months earlier in the bitterest january anyone could remember the numbness of his loss had passed and the pain would hit me out of nowhere doubling me over racking my body with sobs where are you i would cry out in my mind where have you gone of course there was never any answer the district had given us a small amount of money as compensation for his death enough to cover one month of grieving at which time my mother would be expected to get a job only she didnt she didnt do anything but sit propped up in a chair or more often huddled under the blankets on her bed eyes fixed on some point in the distance once in a while shed stir get up as if moved by some urgent purpose only to then collapse back into stillness no amount of pleading from prim seemed to affect her i was terrified i suppose now that my mother was locked in some dark world of sadness but at the time all i knew was that i had lost not only a father but a mother as well at eleven years old with prim just seven i took over as head of the family there was no choice i bought our food at the market and cooked it as best i could and tried to keep prim and myself looking presentable because if it had become known that my mother could no longer care for us the district would have taken us away from her and placed us in the community home id grown up seeing those home kids at school the sadness the marks of angry hands on their faces the hopelessness that curled their shoulders forward i could never let that happen to prim sweet tiny prim who cried when i cried before she even knew the reason who brushed and plaited my mothers hair before we left for school who still polished my fathers shaving mirror each night because hed hated the layer of coal dust that settled on everything in the seam the community home would crush her like a bug so i kept our predicament a secret but the money ran out and we were slowly starving to death theres no other way to put it i kept telling myself if i could only hold out until may just may 8th i would turn twelve and be able to sign up for the tesserae and get that precious grain and oil to feed us only there were still several weeks to go we could well be dead by then starvations not an uncommon fate in district 12 who hasnt seen the victims older people who cant work children from a family with too many to feed those injured in the mines straggling through the
